# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Our data consisted of two csv files (city_data and ride_data), which contained information for the PyBer ride sharing app. We merged the two datasets into a DataFrame using Pandas. The aim of our analysis was to examine a set of key variables for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). Our variables of interest were (1) total number of rides, (2) total number of drivers, (3) total amount of fares, (4) average fare per ride, and (5) average fare per driver. 

## Results

Results are summarized in the table below. The number of total rides and total drivers were larger in urban cities, compared to suburban and rural cities. Moreover, suburban cities had a larger number of total rides and total drivers than rural cities. Thus, unsurprisingly, the total amount of fares was largest for urban cities, and smallest for rural cities. The line graph shows that urban cities were consistently above suburban cities, which were in turn above rural cities, with respect to total fares, for the duration of four months (January to April, 2019)

However, when we examined the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, we found the reverse pattern. Namely, the average fare (both per driver and per ride) was largest for rural cities and smallest for urban cities.

## Summary

Despite the larger number of total rides and total drivers, the average fare per ride (or per driver) was smaller for urban cities, and largest for rural cities. Nevertheless, the largest portion of total fares comes from urban cities, and the smallest portion comes from rural cities.
